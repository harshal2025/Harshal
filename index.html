            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Harshal Porwal</b>, a 16-year-old aspiring technologist and pianist. Iâ€™m currently in 11th grade, preparing for the JEE 2026 exam, but Iâ€™m also passionate about coding, music, and exploring new things. Whether itâ€™s tinkering with Python code or playing piano covers, Iâ€™m always looking to challenge myself and learn something new.</p>

            <h2>Skills and Interests</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m a firm believer in the power of creativity, whether itâ€™s through technology or music. Iâ€™ve been learning coding for a while now, particularly Python, and I'm working on various projects that allow me to combine logic with creativity. Piano is my escape from the digital world, and I love experimenting with new songs and creating my own covers.</p>
            <p>In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me brainstorming ideas for new projects, whether itâ€™s building something with code or whipping up a new recipe in the kitchen. I enjoy pushing myself to be better and to learn something that can make a difference.</p>

Until then, I plan to get into a great college, pursue computer science, and make meaningful contributions to the world.</p>
